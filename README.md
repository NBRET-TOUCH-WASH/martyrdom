## Martyrdom

`Martyrdom` is my final NSI mini-project for the 2022 schoolyear.

I learned quite a bit making it and also ran into quite a few issues, some I learned to fix or find a workaround for, some others I couldn't.

Overall, this was a nice experience for me ; as much suffering as these sort of Game Jams bring, they are in the end very fun to partake in.

`Martyrdom` takes the concept of [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) and gives quite a peculiar spin, not without offering a callback to my other NSI mini-project: [Enter the HomeGeon](https://nbret-touch-wash.github.io/extraSauce/html/eth/eth.html).

## Disclaimer

This project **isn't complete**.

Part of any Game Jam's fun comes from the time constraint, although it sometimes end up too great to completely develop the project.

Such was the case with `Martyrdom`, I ended up leaving significant portions of planned content on the [cutting room floor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_room_floor), a common step for a lot of games mid-development *- see ['The Cutting Room Floor' website](https://tcrf.net) for concrete examples*.
