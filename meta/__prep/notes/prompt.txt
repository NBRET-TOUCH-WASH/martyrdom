so the main prompt is:
a game that suddenly changes gameplay and introduces a plot

=============================

elaborated prompt:

the game starts out as a simple tic-tac-toe, but after a "few" games, it suddenly
changes for a text-based adventure game, the likes of Colossal Cave Adventure

in this section of the game, you are suddenly facing what seems to be a
terminal-based truth or dare, starting out innocently, but devolving into serious
questions about you and your actions.

the "canon" storyline follow the player honestly answering each question, though
it soon appears that the "engine"(?) asking the questions' opinion is very
oriented in favor of some sort of futuristic techno-theocratic government(?).

the game then shifts for a roguelike/dungeon crawler type of game, ressembling
what we did as the first mini-project, a nice wrapup to this year's work and
ativities
:D

---

the truth or dare shifts to the roguelike phase by the player inputting "canon"
answers, resulting in the "engine" announcing that you will be
prosecuted/convicted of some horrible charge i have yet to think of :^)

-

the game over screen would be the game's ASCII logo, followed by a short message
the like of Shadowgate's death screen's on the NES.
basically smthn along thee lines of:

you [insert fate here].
you feel like finally fathoming the perception of [Martyrdom]. <- in brackets yes

^

btw whenever "Martyrdom" is being written anywhere at any point in the game, it
appears in brackets : [like this] = [Martyrdom]
