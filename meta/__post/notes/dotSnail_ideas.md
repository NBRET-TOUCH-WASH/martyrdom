# SPACE_CREW_THROUGH_SPACE.snail ideas

---

### 1
    Incorporate FrankJavCee's speech in the DJ Mustard video (track name is "Mustard", I believe.)

---

### 2
    For the Main Theme and trailer of the game, get some music (ask help from Fémi for example), and remix it into something like 'Reckoning', from the final Nights 4 OST.

---

### 2.1
    Maybe this song could actually be for the PLAYER.path path, or the other game following the PLAYER.path?

---

### 3
    Each path are named ’<path_name>.path’

---

### 4
    Each ending is named ’<ending_name>.end’

---

### 5
    There is a difference between 'you' (The player's character) ; 'You' (The Player itself) ; ’YOU’ (The Player IRL, stylized as ’PLAYER’) (notice the capital letters)

---

### 5.1
    whereas the player is "highlighted" in white (just like the rest of the text, he actually isn't technically highlighted), the Player is highlighted in green (#00FF00), and the PLAYER in #00FF00 and capital letters

---

### 5.2
    There will be an ENTIRE story path where the story progressively gets darker and darker as the player realize he in fact is the Player and is in a simulation all along (explaining why the main menu is entirely green, and other stuff like that), and that the player is the Player which is in fact the PLAYER

---

### 5.3
    This path would be called ’PLAYER.path’

---

### 5.4
    For the PLAYER.path trailer, the main words (words that appear on screen, “define“ the theme or things like that) would be : « Two Layers. One user. » ; « Three Layers. One User. » (notice the case of the letters!)

---

### 6
    For the game trailer, make a song like 'SAMUS ARAN' by Alex ('Magnatron III album').
    Mixing trap and synthwave elements.

---

### 7
    If there is a character named Stanley, insert the sentence:
    “And Stanley was happy.”
