ideas to implement in the long run
=================================== +

- the j-man comes to get the player to stop some old eldritch gods in some weird matrix-like reality
    - by using snails and slugs
        <- plug in of my old abandonned visual novel/multimedium idea
            -!-> see `dotSnail_ideas.md`
            - why not actually complete a visual novel this time?
                -!-> keep the three layers of "you
                    - "you" = "The player's character"
                    - "You" = "The Player itself"
                    - "YOU" = "The Player IRL, stylized as ’PLAYER’"
